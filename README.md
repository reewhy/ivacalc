# VAT Calculator
Sample app used to calculate VAT (the default percentage is based on the default Italian IVA value), it has a front-end made in VueJS/TailwindCSS and a back-end made in Python using [Tesseract_OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)

## Premises
The app is just a text and you should always do a check on if it has actually detected the real number. I'm not planning to keep on working on this.
